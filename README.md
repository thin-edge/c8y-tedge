The extension can be installed using the following command.

c8y extension install thin-edge/c8y-tedge
```

## Examples

### Start a demo container

Start a demo container using a randomly generated device name:

```sh
c8y tedge demo start
```

Or you can specify the device name to be used:

```
c8y tedge demo start tedge0001
```

Or you can specify the auth-type you want to use (e.g. certificate (default) or basic):

```sh
c8y tedge demo start tedge0001 --auth-type basic

c8y tedge demo start tedge0001 --auth-type certificate
```

### Bootstrap device via ssh

Bootstrap a thin-edge.io enable device using SSH.

```sh
c8y tedge bootstrap root@raspberrypi3-64.local
```

The bootstrapping processes does:

* Create the device certificate (if required)
* Fetch public device certificate and upload it to Cumulocity IoT (private key does not leave the device)
* Open the device in the Cumulocity IoT Device Management application
